This repository demonstrates a common runtime panic in Rust: accessing a vector element with an index that exceeds the vector's bounds. The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, which uses `.unwrap()` on the result of `vec.get()`, leading to a panic if the index is out of bounds.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that safely handles the `Option` returned by `get()`, preventing the panic.
